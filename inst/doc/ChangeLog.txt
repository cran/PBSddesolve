-----------------------------------

1.10  2013-05-03
  - Updated `PBSddesolve-UG.pdf` to reflect new Lorenz GUI and updated weblinks. (RH 5/3)
  - Updated `PBSddesolveIntro` Rnw and pdf to alert the reader that examples run in new environment called `.PBSddeEnv`. (RH 5/2)
  - Introduced new temporary working environment `.PBSddeEnv` in which examples can be run. (RH 5/2)
  - Fix "start time" bug introduced in r19 ( issue 4 ) (NB 5/2)
	In r19, a line that initialized t to t0 was cut.  This update restores that line and addresses  issue 4 .
	This update also renames an identifier so that it now differs from the R "error" function.
  - Moved `PBSddesolveIntro.Rnw` to `vignettes` directory. (RH 4/25)
  - Advanced version for resubmission to CRAN and to avoid some nonsense message during Rcheck:
	`Version contains leading zeroes (1.09)` (RH 4/25)

1.09  2013-04-25
  - Fixed compilation issue on Windows along with two compiler warnings. (NB 4/25)
  - Moved banner message to `.onAttach` and fixed warnings. (NB 3/23)
  - Removed `info` (unused) and `PBSerror`, and added calls to `error`. (NB 12/5)
  - Changed an 'exit' to a 'return' in 'PBSddesolve.c'. (RH 11/01)
  - Jon changed email address to schnutej-dfo@shaw.ca (RH 10/31)
  - R-2.14.0 requires namespace and loading via '.onLoad'. (RH 11/10)

1.08  2010-11-07  Alex
  - Merged in Bobby's memory clean up modifications. (ACB 11/7)
  - Added check to delete global memory when startDDE is interrupted by the user,
	memory is only cleared on subsequent calls to startDDE (or clean exits). (ACB 11/4)
  - Removed dummy_var nonsense, and refactored to simply pass a NULL rather than have a static pointer malloced 
	(which caused a potential buffer overflow on subsequent calls with larger number of variables to solve). (ACB 11/4)
  - Fixed memory leak; fixes Issue 3. (ACB 10/3)
  - Moved old ddesolve to branches. (ACB 9/27)
  - Added 'freeglobaldata()' to PBSddesolve.c to fix memory leak. (ACB 8/27)
  - Included the short deprecated version of ddesolve. (ACB 6/23)
  - Added a minor comment to PBSddesolve.c. Changed version to 1.08. (ACB 4/20)
