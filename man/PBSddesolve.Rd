\title{
  Package: Solver for Delay Differential Equations
}
\description{
  A solver for systems of delay differential equations based on 
  numerical routines from 
  \href{https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/}{Simon Wood}'s
  \code{solv95} program. 
  This solver is also capable of solving systems of ordinary
  differential equations.

\details{
  Please see the user guide \code{PBSddesolve-UG.pdf}, located in R's
  library directory \code{./library/PBSddesolve/doc}, for a 
  comprehensive overview.
